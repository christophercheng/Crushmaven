The Services may also include virtual, in-Services digital items (the “Virtual Goods”) that can be acquired in exchange for different amounts of Virtual Currency.  Flirtally may charge fees for the right to use Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods, or may distribute Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods without charge, in its sole discretion.

The purchase and sale of this limited license is a completed transaction upon receipt of your direct payment or redemption of a third party payment system like Facebook Credits.
</p>
<h3>c. Availability of Virtual Currencies and Virtual Goods</h3>
<p>
The length of time a Virtual Currency or Virtual Good is available and/or accessible will be determined by Flirtally at its sole discretion.  The existence or availability of a Virtual Currency or Virtual Good, specifically or generally, at any point of time, in no way guarantees that Flirtally shall continue to make that Virtual Currency or Virtual Good available in the future.  Flirtally may revise, discontinue, or modify Virtual Goods at any time without providing prior notice and Flirtally shall bear no liability of any kind for a Virtual Currency or Virtual Good that is no longer available or accessible.  To the extent you earn or purchase any Virtual Currency, Virtual Goods or redeem Virtual Currency for a Virtual Good, we will make the Virtual Currency available to you or, if a gift, your intended recipient, but, any obligation to make such Virtual Currency or Virtual Good available or accessible ends when delivery is complete.
</p>
<h3>d. Right To Manage Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods</h3>
<p>
Flirtally has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and Flirtally shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.
</p>
<h3>e. Transfer of License Prohibited</h3>
<p>
Transfers of Virtual Currencies and Virtual Goods are strictly prohibited except where explicitly authorized within the Services.

Any attempt to do so is in violation of These Terms and may result in account Termination and possible legal action.
</p>
<h3>f. All Sales Final</h3>
<p>
You agree that all sales of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currencies are final and to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your Account.
